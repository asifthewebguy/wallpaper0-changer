A Windows application that changes desktop wallpapers using images from aiwp.me via a custom URL protocol. Simply click on a `wallpaper0-changer:` link, and the application will download and set the wallpaper automatically.

- Downloads images from aiwp.me API
- Sets desktop wallpaper using Windows API
- Runs in the system tray with a custom logo icon for minimal interference
- Caches downloaded images to avoid re-downloading

- Custom logo icon

4. The installer will build and install the application

## Usage

To set a wallpaper, use a link with the following format:

```
wallpaper0-changer:image_id
```

Where `image_id` is the ID of the image on aiwp.me.

- Exit the application

## Development

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Windows 10 or later

### Building

```
dotnet build -c Release
```

### Running

```
dotnet run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Protocol Handler Not Working

If clicking on `wallpaper0-changer:` links doesn't work:

1. Make sure the application is installed correctly
2. Run the registration script again (`register_protocol.ps1` or `register_protocol_user.ps1`)
3. Restart your browser
4. Check if your browser is blocking custom protocol handlers

#### Application Not Starting

If the application doesn't start:

**For Standalone Version:**
1. Make sure you extracted ALL files from the zip archive
2. Check that the `Resources` folder is in the same location as the executable
3. Try running as administrator
4. Check Windows Event Viewer for any error messages

**For Source Build Version:**
1. Check if .NET Runtime is installed
2. Try running the application as administrator
3. Check Windows Event Viewer for any error messages

#### Windows Security Warning

If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC":
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. This happens because the executable isn't digitally signed
