# Wallpaper Changer Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the Wallpaper Changer application to improve performance, maintainability, and extensibility.

  - [ ] Add proper dependency injection

- [ ] Add API response caching
  - [ ] Implement in-memory cache for API responses
  - [ ] Add proper cache invalidation strategies
  - [ ] Implement offline mode support

### Low Priority Tasks

- [ ] Enhance API client features
  - [ ] Add support for multiple API endpoints/services

  - [ ] Implement a more efficient timer mechanism
  - [ ] Add proper thread management and cleanup

- [ ] Add scheduler persistence

  - [ ] Implement more schedule types (daily, weekly, custom intervals)
  - [ ] Add option to exclude certain time periods

- [ ] Improve scheduler reliability
  - [ ] Implement recovery for missed schedules
  - [ ] Add logging for scheduler events
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling

  - [ ] Implement calendar integration
  - [ ] Add support for location-based scheduling (sunrise/sunset)
  - [ ] Implement theme-based scheduling (different wallpapers for different themes)

## 4. URL Protocol Handling

The current URL protocol handling has excessive logging to multiple files and redundant URL parsing in multiple places.

### High Priority Tasks

- [ ] Centralize URL protocol handling
  - [ ] Create a dedicated `ProtocolHandler` class
  - [ ] Implement proper URL parsing and validation
  - [ ] Centralize logging for protocol events

- [ ] Improve installation process
  - [ ] Create a proper installation/registration system
  - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Implement proper path handling for different installation locations

### Medium Priority Tasks

- [ ] Enhance protocol features
  - [ ] Add support for additional parameters (style, duration)
  - [ ] Implement proper command-line argument parsing
  - [ ] Add support for batch operations

- [ ] Improve security
  - [ ] Add validation for incoming URLs
  - [ ] Implement proper sanitization of inputs
  - [ ] Add option to confirm protocol actions

### Low Priority Tasks

- [ ] Add advanced protocol features
  - [ ] Implement custom protocol schemes
  - [ ] Add support for API-based operations
  - [ ] Implement integration with other applications

## 5. GUI Architecture

The current GUI implementation is monolithic with too many responsibilities and excessive use of threading without proper management.

### High Priority Tasks

- [ ] Implement MVC or MVVM pattern
  - [ ] Separate UI code from business logic
  - [ ] Create proper view models for data binding
  - [ ] Implement proper state management

- [ ] Improve thread management
  - [ ] Centralize thread creation and management
  - [ ] Implement proper cancellation for background tasks
  - [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running operations

### Medium Priority Tasks

  - [ ] Implement accessibility features

## 6. Logging System

The current logging system is inconsistent across different modules with multiple log files containing overlapping information.

### High Priority Tasks

- [ ] Centralize logging configuration
  - [ ] Create a dedicated logging module
  - [ ] Implement consistent logging across all modules
  - [ ] Add proper log levels for different environments

- [ ] Implement log management

  - [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with high-priority tasks in each category
2. Create unit tests for each component before refactoring
3. Refactor one component at a time to minimize disruption
4. Validate changes with both automated tests and manual testing
5. Document changes and update user documentation as needed

## Success Metrics

- Reduced memory usage and CPU utilization
- Faster startup time and UI responsiveness
- Reduced disk space usage for cache
- Improved code maintainability (measured by complexity metrics)
- Better user experience (measured by reduced error rates and improved performance)
